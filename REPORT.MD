# Approximate Program Synthesis for Efficient Machine Learning

This doc contains more detailed information on the project and the experiments I ran, what worked and what didn't, and generally anything that's out of place in the [README.MD](README.MD).

## Project idea
The primary goal was to use a **Syntax-Guided Synthesizer (SyGuS)** to automatically generate hardware logic for fundamental operations in low-precision formats. For this project I primarily worked with the [MXInt](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.10537) format, allocating 4 bits for the mantissa and 4 bits for the exponent.
