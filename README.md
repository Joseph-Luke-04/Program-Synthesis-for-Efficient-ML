# Approximate Program Synthesis for Efficient Machine Learning

This repository contains the code and results for a summer research project on automatically generating hardware logic for approximate multiplication in low-precision number formats used for machine learning.

Details of experiments are in REPORT.MD


Project was under the supervision of Dr Jianyi Cheng and Dr Elizabeth Polgreen.
